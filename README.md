# D3-Multi Axis Census Plot

The purpose of this project was to read in a CSV file containing 2016 US Census Bureau data and creating an interactive scatter plot with mutliple x and y axes using the D3 library within javascript. The x-axis will contain data for three different aspects from the csv: the percentage of those in poverty, the median age, and the median household income.  The y-axis will contain data from three different aspects from the csv: the percentage of those lacking healthcare, the percantage of those that smoke, and the percentage of those who are considered obese. Upon clicking on one of these three axes labels for either the x or y axes, the plot points will shift within the scatter plot to show the comparison between the selected datasets. Each circle plotted accounts for a specific state, the abbreviation of each state will appear within their respective circle. When hovering over any of the points in the scatter plot, a tooltip will appear showing the state name and the specific data describing where and why it is placed where it is in the scatter plot.  The html was formatted to add a title for the scatter plot and to add a box for the title of the project.

Collaboration with Kate Spitzer. State abbreviation text labelling code was on Stack Overflow, special thanks to Annette Broeren and Kevin Mickey for sharing link to page.
